## ðŸ”§ Two Issues to Fix

### **Issue 1: Health Endpoint (Nginx Routing)**

**Error:**
```html
Cannot GET /api/health
```

**Cause:** Nginx is routing `https://api.wemakemarin.com/api/health` incorrectly.

**Fix:** Update Nginx config to properly route `/api/health`:

```bash
ssh root@23.128.116.9
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/wemakemarin

# Find the api.wemakemarin.com server block
# Make sure it has:
location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}

# Save and restart Nginx
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### **Issue 2: Invoices Endpoint (Column Name)**

**Error:**
```json
{"success":false,"message":"Failed to fetch invoices","error":"column invoices_lineItems.invoice_id does not exist"}
```

**Cause:** The compiled JavaScript uses `invoices_lineItems` but the database table is `invoice_line_items`.

**Fix on Server:**
```bash
ssh root@23.128.116.9
cd /opt/dashboard/backend

# Backup the file
cp dist/routes/invoices.js dist/routes/invoices.js.backup

# Fix the column name
sed -i 's/invoices_lineItems/invoice_line_items/g' dist/routes/invoices.js

# Restart PM2
pm2 restart all

# Test
curl https://api.wemakemarin.com/api/invoices
```

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insight: Why It Works Now

**Before:** Tried to rebuild with TypeScript errors  
**Now:** Using pre-compiled JavaScript from `dist/` folder

**The compiled code works because:**
- âœ… It was compiled when schema matched database
- âœ… QuickBooks OAuth logic is intact
- âœ… Token refresh is working
- âœ… Database connections are working
- âœ… No need to rebuild unless you change TypeScript source

## ðŸ§ª Test Your Frontend

Open your browser:
- https://wemakemarin.com/customers (should show 576 customers)
- https://wemakemarin.com/products (should show 100 items)
- https://wemakemarin.com/invoices (will work after fixing column name)

## ðŸ“‹ Commands to Run Right Now

```bash
ssh root@23.128.116.9
cd /opt/dashboard/backend

# Fix invoices endpoint
sed -i 's/invoices_lineItems/invoice_line_items/g' dist/routes/invoices.js

# Restart
pm2 restart all

# Test invoices
curl https://api.wemakemarin.com/api/invoices
```

**This should return invoices data!** ðŸš€
